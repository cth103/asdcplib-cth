asdcplib-cth
======

This fork is based on asdcplib 2.5.11 and has the following basic changes needed for [libdcp](https://github.com/cth103/libdcp) and hence [dcp-o-matic](https://github.com/cth103/dcpomatic):

- Tweaks to allow resumption of writes to partial MXFs.
- Additions to allow hashing of MXFs while they are being written.
- Replacement of some code with shorter versions using boost.
- Fixes for various compiler warnings.

asdcplib is ‘an open source implementation of SMPTE and the MXF Interop “Sound & Picture Track File” format. It was originally developed with support from DCI. Development is currently supported by CineCert and other d-cinema manufacturers. See the bundled README file for more information. asdcplib is implemented in C++ and builds on Win32 and most unix platforms that support GCC.’
